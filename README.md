# Bankist-App


## About
This is a project I completed as part of Jonas Schmedtmann's The Complete JavaScript Course 2023 on Udemy. The Bankist Website is a fictional online banking website that allows users to view their account balances, transfer money, request loans, and close their accounts.

Bankist Website includes several  features such as lazy loading images, a sticky navigation bar, smooth scrolling, and a slider for showcasing users reviews.


I would like to give credit to Jonas Schmedtmann for his excellent course and for providing me with the knowledge and guidance to complete this project.
